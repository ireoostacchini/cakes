This project contains a node / typescript web API; it was developed in two days for a technical test.



## Approach



I decided to set myself a time limit of two days, and focus on the work most relevant to the job description - the back-end API. 

That meant I was not able to work on a front-end, or successfully deploy the API to the cloud.



## Architecture





##Installation

 go to /docker

 run docker-compose up -d
